# Digital Clock

## What did you learn while making this app?

I learned how to use JavaScriptâ€™s `Date` object to get the current time and how to update the display every second using `setInterval`. I also practiced manipulating the DOM to show dynamic content on the webpage.

## What feature did you enjoy building the most?

I enjoyed creating the live updating clock that shows hours, minutes, and seconds in real-time. Making the time update seamlessly every second was really satisfying.

## What would you add next if you had more time?

I would add options to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, include a date display, and maybe add an alarm feature to make it more functional.
